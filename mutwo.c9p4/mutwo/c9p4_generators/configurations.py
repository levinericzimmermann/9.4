DEFAULT_OFFLINE_TEXT = r"""Owners manuals may not make exciting reading, but they are packed with valuable instructions, information and warnings. We have made it easy for you to find a car owner's manual without any digging. And by having access to a manual online or by storing it on your computer, you have convenient answers when you're not in the car.

Almost all automakers have made owner's manuals available on their Web sites. All of the online owner's manuals are free, while the paper versions cost anywhere from $25-$40. Below is a list of links to help you get an online manual from a car's manufacturer. In most cases, you can just search for a car's year, make and model, and then view the manual. In some cases however, you'll need to register at the carmaker's site. Occasionally you'll need to provide a car's vehicle identification number (VIN). You can find the VIN on the vehicle registration document, an insurance card or on the vehicle itself.

Other resources for car owner's manuals are Web sites such as "Just Give Me the Damn Manual" archive manuals and share them with other owners.
